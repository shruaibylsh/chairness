These rare pieces have molded laminate wood structures and were part of the first line of furniture from L’atelier. Designed for the launch of the store, this collection still had the execution and details of artisanal woodwork but already introduced some techniques and materials considered innovative. Brasiliana armchairs and sofa take advantage of molded laminate to create a light structure that elegantly comfortable cushions. The pieces are composed of rectangular plywood boards with curved ends, assembled together by small metal parts and the well-known brass cross-head screws characteristic of L’atelier. Much more than rationalizing design, Zalszupin focused mainly on the acquisition and use of new technologies and materials to make series production viable. Oswaldo Mellone, an architect and designer who worked as Zalszupin's assistant, said the Brasiliana series is inspired by the architecture of the palaces and buildings designed by Oscar Niemeyer for the country's new capital, Brasília. In fact, the armchair legs are very similar to the columns of the Federal Supreme Court, built between 1958 and 1960. These Brasiliana armchairs are in very good vintage condition and have the original upholstery.

The inlay, thanks to the chromatic difference of the woods used, draws a decorative bezel on the back of the armchair. A formal simplicity revealing at the same time great craftsmanship. What makes Thumb really special is the voluminous padding of the seat and back cushions, made of variable density polyurethane, which effectively communicate comfort and clean shapes. Thumb is designed to be used as a lounge chair but offers the possibility of transforming itself in a sofa joining together several elements. The armrest is conceived as an accessory element and can optionally be inserted according to the composition needs.

Combining traditional woodworking techniques with exceptionally elegant, innovative free-flowing modern curves and forms, Vaughan has created an exceptionally accomplished and aesthetically pleasing piece of contemporary furniture, wherein the very essence and beauty of two-dimensional calligraphy or paint strokes seems to have found form in three dimensions, freely flowing with neither start point nor end. Vaughan was trained in traditional cabinet making and carpentry at the London College of Furniture, and found his passion in combining these skills with modern and digital design techniques, which enabled him to create daring and highly original designs that combine the elegance and beauty of traditional carpentry with the minimalism, economy of material, and sophistication of contemporary styles. Inspired by the likes of Barbara Hepworth and Henry Moore, its smooth tactile quality and beautiful flowing form of this piece embody and encapsulate its essential nature as a functional sculpture, and its status as a contemporary interior design piece like no other. The s-chair is available in each of the following materials: American black walnut, European oak and American white ash. The piece shown here is executed in stained Ash, with the full range of tones with differing stains of the chair in Ash shown in the last two photographs.",the wooden chair is designed to look like it has curved legs and an unusual shape,https://i.pinimg.com/736x/f8/05/c6/f805c6e4c35821e99d2d404222fd3f3d.jpg
