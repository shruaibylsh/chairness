132011832822792604,"Pair of Brasiliana Armchairs by Jorge Zalszupin, 1965, Brazilian Midcentury","The iconic Brasiliana is a series composed of a sofa and armchair designed by Jorge Zalszupin (1922-2020) in 1965 and produced by his company, L'atelier. These rare pieces have molded laminate wood structures and were part of the first line of furniture from L’atelier. Designed for the launch of the store, this collection still had the execution and details of artisanal woodwork but already introduced some techniques and materials considered innovative. Brasiliana armchairs and sofa take advantage of molded laminate to create a light structure that elegantly comfortable cushions. The pieces are composed of rectangular plywood boards with curved ends, assembled together by small metal parts and the well-known brass cross-head screws characteristic of L’atelier. Much more than rationalizing design, Zalszupin focused mainly on the acquisition and use of new technologies and materials to make series production viable. Oswaldo Mellone, an architect and designer who worked as Zalszupin's assistant, said the Brasiliana series is inspired by the architecture of the palaces and buildings designed by Oscar Niemeyer for the country's new capital, Brasília. In fact, the armchair legs are very similar to the columns of the Federal Supreme Court, built between 1958 and 1960. These Brasiliana armchairs are in very good vintage condition and have the original upholstery.

Combining traditional woodworking techniques with exceptionally elegant, innovative free-flowing modern curves and forms, Vaughan has created an exceptionally accomplished and aesthetically pleasing piece of contemporary furniture, wherein the very essence and beauty of two-dimensional calligraphy or paint strokes seems to have found form in three dimensions, freely flowing with neither start point nor end. Vaughan was trained in traditional cabinet making and carpentry at the London College of Furniture, and found his passion in combining these skills with modern and digital design techniques, which enabled him to create daring and highly original designs that combine the elegance and beauty of traditional carpentry with the minimalism, economy of material, and sophistication of contemporary styles. Inspired by the likes of Barbara Hepworth and Henry Moore, its smooth tactile quality and beautiful flowing form of this piece embody and encapsulate its essential nature as a functional sculpture, and its status as a contemporary interior design piece like no other. The s-chair is available in each of the following materials: American black walnut, European oak and American white ash. The piece shown here is executed in stained Ash, with the full range of tones with differing stains of the chair in Ash shown in the last two photographs.",the wooden chair is designed to look like it has curved legs and an unusual shape,https://i.pinimg.com/736x/f8/05/c6/f805c6e4c35821e99d2d404222fd3f3d.jpg

In 1966 Afra & Tobia Scarpa designed the ""925"" chair, realized in walnut and leather. The armchair is inspired by a sketch made in 1943 by the architect Carlo Scarpa, Tobia's father, and uses the solutions adopted for the ""121"" chair. The overall measurements and thickness of the planks find completely new proportions: the side of the seat increases, the height of the feet, and the design of the back are modified to create an enveloping shape. The initial idea is to put together a cube with a petal. The elegance of a petal becomes the back of the chair, and the structure is the cube that indicates the object's solidity. An elegant lounge chair is characterized by the formal rigidity of the frame, which contrasts with the lightness of the shape of the backrest. The seat's comfort is entrusted to the anatomical conformation and the natural elasticity of the cantilevered backrest on the crosspiece. Our atelier carefully checked the chairs. All the signs and imperfections on the surface are natural leather features, enhancing the material's natural beauty. Our atelier offers custom restoration and special reupholstering on request.

As an American born in Haverhill, Massachusetts, his distinctive design were often influenced by his Scandinavian roots. Lawrence studied at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen, Denmark and at the Rhode Island School of Design. His early career with Selig Mfg. Co. was prolific and helped put both himself and Selig on the map for modern furniture. He then started Lawrence Peabody & Associates in 1955, a design firm in Boston which included a vast client list (Sears, Roebuck & Co., Kohler, Regal Rugs, Boyd Lighting, Chapman Lamps, and Richardson Brothers).
