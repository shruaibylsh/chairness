The Miniatures Collection encapsulates the entire history of industrial furniture design - moving from Historicism and Art Nouveau to the New Objectivity of Bauhaus and Radical Design, and from Postmodernism all the way up to the present day. Exactly one sixth of the size of the historical originals, the chairs are all true to scale and precisely recreate the smallest details of construction, material and color. The high standard of authenticity even extends to the natural grain of the wood, the reproduction of screws and the elaborate handicraft techniques involved. This has made the miniatures into popular collector's items as well as ideal illustrative material for universities, design schools and architects. Knotted Chair is made of knotted netting soaked in artificial resin and simply hung out to dry. This produces a highly expressive seat shell which is as fragile, transparent and light as a hammock but is as solid as a seat should be. The use of simple knotted cords gives Knotted Chair that additional warm, personal feeling. Wanders' description of Knotted Chair: ""The design is based on three innovations. Firstly, the process of hardening a textile in such a way that it can serve as a constructional element, becoming part of the structure of a three-dimensional product. Secondly, the use of knotting techniques to create curved, solid surfaces and structures. Thirdly, the manufacture of an industrial product made of plastic without resorting to a mold, but by simply making use of gravity and artificial resin as a stiffening agent. Of course these factors are decisive in determining the quality of the chair. I personally, however, I am more enthusiastic about the chair's formal appeal and the meaning its external appearance lends it. It is a chair which tells you it was made for you alone, with a great deal of love, creativity and care, a chair which thus has its own personal and individual character, a chair which shows its relationship to you by letting you see different details every time you use it.""

728598045995568786,Gufram Pratone Sofa Designed by Ceretti/ Derossi and Rosso,"""An icon is forever, but to be still contemporary it has to adapt to the present times” Perfect for the home and for contract, since it complies with the legislation that governs furnishings of public places, the fabric is available in three different tones of green, green, greener e greenest, which on the one hand recall the classic color of PRATONE® and on the other play on the fact that, over the years, that green has never been identical to itself. Each PRATONE®, in fact, can be considered a unique piece, being entirely finished by hand. More restrained in its dimensions – being 30% smaller than the original one and featuring 25 stams instead of the classic 42, to adapt to the spaces of contemporary dwellings – PRATONE® FOREVER remains faithful to the Radical spirit that distinguishes its aesthetic. The base still bears its name embossed in quotes: if in the original version the word ""PRATONE” is engraved directly in the polyurethane, here it is silkscreened in black on the fabric, keeping the original font unchanged. On the occasion of Milano Design Week 2021, Gufram celebrates the fiftieth anniversary of one of its most famous icons: PRATONE®. Always careful to preserve the visionary and nonconformist spirit of Italian Radical Design, the brand once again pays homage to its history with a special edition of the most innovative seating in the history of design. PRATONE® FOREVER is the spin-off of its famous predecessor: open edition of the famous modular chaise longue which subverts the idea of ""sitting down”, this new version preserves its surreal aesthetic but is covered in fabric available in three different tones of green, while its more contained dimensions makes it easier to be inserted into any domestic space. PRATONE® FOREVER is the version which was born to celebrate the 50th anniversary of this timeless icon, a myth which reinvents itself and becomes eternal, approaching the dimension of furnishing more and more. While maintaining its soft polyurethane soul – a material which has always characterized Gufram products – PRATONE® FOREVER changes its ""skin”: originally covered in Guflac®, the special paint invented and patented by the company to coat its creations in polyurethane while still maintaining their softness and elasticity, this special edition is covered in an elastic wool bouclé fabric that adheres perfectly to the eccentric forms of this out of the ordinary chair, ensuring excellent resistance to wear and tear.",a green plastic object with the word pratoe on it's side and four rows of sticks sticking out of it,https://i.pinimg.com/736x/4b/9f/5f/4b9f5f282f714927a19dc90a498dfb72.jpg

Thanks to the knit sling cover, the Slow Chair combines soft comfort with ergonomic support, which is further enhanced by thin seat and back cushions. The translucent sling cover replaces the thick cushions of traditional armchairs, resulting in a design that is lightweight, yet generously proportioned. The restrained appearance of the Slow Chair is equally appealing in the living room or conservatory, while offering unrestrained seating comfort. The two brothers, Ronan and Erwan, have been working together since 1999. Their collaboration is a constant dialogue, nourished by their single identities and strived towards a common goal. Today, the Bouroullec brothers work with numerous manufacturers such as Vitra, Cappellini, Issey Miyake, Magis, Ligne Roset, Habitat and the Kréo Gallery. They were named ""Creator of the Year"" in 2002, elected ""designer of the year"" in 2003 and have won multiple other awards. Their creations have been exhibited in many collective or solo exhibitions and are part of some permanent museum collections around the world. The Slow chair includes seat and two back cushions (as pictured). It is available with polished aluminum or powder coated smooth chocolate legs in your choice of knitted tricot fabric colors. Matching ottoman also available. Please refer to diagrams for specific cushion color combinations for each chair.","an outdoor area with chairs, plants and potted plants on the side of the building",https://i.pinimg.com/736x/e1/7e/2e/e17e2ecba4937bf48c7d284ef1fade13.jpg

This is due to the distinctive aesthetic of French designer, architect and engineer Jean Prouvé, who always placed an uncompromising focus on functional requirements. Jean Prouvé (1901-1984), architect, engineer and designer, was endeavored for using highly-developed technologies for metal processing to achieve innovative constructions and forms in his design and architecture work. He played a decisive part in developing construction techniques using light-weight prefabricated parts in architecture, making use, among other things, of insights from the airplane and automotive industry. In his Ateliers Jean Prouvé, the company he founded in 1947, he started not only producing light-weight components but also his own design drafts. The voluminous seat and backrest cushions rest on a sleek frame made of tubular steel and bent sheet metal, while the wooden armrests lend the office chair a touch of familiar comfort. The swivel seat of Fauteuil Direction Pivotant is height adjustable, and the backward tilt mechanism can be adapted to the individual user's weight. These features are paired with the generous upholstery to ensure optimum comfort. Leather or fabric covers are available in many different colors, making it easy to find the ideal chair for any type of business workplace or home office.","an office chair with wheels and casteors on the back, viewed from the front",https://i.pinimg.com/736x/68/41/d6/6841d653df22859e374b071210b9beac.jpg
