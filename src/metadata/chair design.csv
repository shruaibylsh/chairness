Combining traditional woodworking techniques with exceptionally elegant, innovative free-flowing modern curves and forms, Vaughan has created an exceptionally accomplished and aesthetically pleasing piece of contemporary furniture, wherein the very essence and beauty of two-dimensional calligraphy or paint strokes seems to have found form in three dimensions, freely flowing with neither start point nor end. Vaughan was trained in traditional cabinet making and carpentry at the London College of Furniture, and found his passion in combining these skills with modern and digital design techniques, which enabled him to create daring and highly original designs that combine the elegance and beauty of traditional carpentry with the minimalism, economy of material, and sophistication of contemporary styles. Inspired by the likes of Barbara Hepworth and Henry Moore, its smooth tactile quality and beautiful flowing form of this piece embody and encapsulate its essential nature as a functional sculpture, and its status as a contemporary interior design piece like no other.
